Sure, Will. I can create a workout plan for you that will last around 30 minutes and be moderate to light activity. Here are some exercises you can do that are easy on your shoulder: 

1. Wall sits: Stand with your back against the wall, and slide down into a seated position. Hold for 15-30 seconds. 
2. Standing shoulder rolls: Stand with your arms by your sides, and roll your shoulders forward and backward slowly, 5 times. 
3. Pushups: Do modified pushups on your knees, aiming for 10-15 reps. 
4. Triceps dips: Sit on a chair, and lower yourself down until your arms are bent at a 90 degree angle. Push back up and repeat 10-15 times. 
5. Squats: Stand with your feet shoulder width apart, and lower yourself down until your thighs are parallel to the ground. Push back up and repeat 10-15 times. 
6. Lunges: Step forward with one foot, and lower your body until your back knee is almost touching the ground. Push back up and repeat 10-15 times on each leg. 
7. Plank: Get into a plank position, keeping your back and legs straight. Hold for 15-30 seconds. 
8. Jumping jacks: Perform 10-15 jumping jacks. 
9. Step ups: Step up onto a low box or ledge, and then step back down. Aim for 10-15 reps on each leg. 
10. Cool down: Take 5-10 minutes to cool down with a light jog or walk.
