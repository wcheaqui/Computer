Ingredients:

For the crust:

1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter, cold and cut into small pieces
3-4 tablespoons ice water
For the filling:

6 eggs
1 cup heavy cream
1 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
1 cup grated cheese (such as cheddar or Swiss)
1 cup cooked and chopped vegetables (such as spinach, mushrooms, onions, or broccoli)
Instructions:

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and sugar until well combined.
Using a pastry cutter or your hands, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Gradually add in the ice water, one tablespoon at a time, and mix until the dough comes together into a ball.
Flatten the dough into a disk and wrap it in plastic wrap. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface until it's about 1/8-inch thick.
Carefully transfer the dough to a 9-inch (23 cm) pie dish and trim any excess dough around the edges.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, heavy cream, milk, salt, pepper, and nutmeg until well combined.
Stir in the grated cheese and chopped vegetables.
Pour the egg mixture into the prepared pie crust.
Bake the quiche for 35-40 minutes, or until the center is set and the top is golden brown.
Remove the quiche from the oven and let it cool for 5-10 minutes before slicing and serving.
