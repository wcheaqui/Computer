For a delicious sauce to top your chicken and vegetables, try making a simple pan sauce. Heat some butter in a pan, add a few cloves of garlic, then add some white wine or chicken broth. Reduce the liquid until it thickens, and then stir in some fresh herbs like thyme, oregano, or parsley. Finish the sauce with a squeeze of lemon juice and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. Serve your sauce over the cooked chicken and vegetables. Enjoy!
