The POS_T.POS_RTLR_SC_TREND_AGG_D0316 and the POS_T.POS_CHNL_MCCF_SC_TREND_AGG are matching based on the query

the 2 dashboards are matching each other, but the numbers are slightly inconsistant when I compare the base tables with the dashboards, I believe that this is due to the refreshing of the dashboards that happened today.

I will run the query tomorrow
