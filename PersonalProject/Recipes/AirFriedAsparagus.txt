Ingredients:

1 bunch of asparagus, trimmed
1 tablespoon olive oil
Salt and pepper, to taste
Instructions:

Preheat your air fryer to 400°F (200°C).

Wash and trim the asparagus by snapping off the woody ends.

Place the asparagus in a bowl and drizzle with olive oil. Toss to coat evenly.

Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Place the asparagus in a single layer in the air fryer basket.

Cook for 8-10 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through cooking time, until the asparagus is tender and lightly browned.

Remove the asparagus from the air fryer basket and serve immediately.
