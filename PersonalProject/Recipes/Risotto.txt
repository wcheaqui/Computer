Ingredients:

1 1/2 cups arborio rice
4 cups chicken or vegetable broth
1/2 cup dry white wine
1/2 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
Salt and pepper, to taste
Instructions:

In a medium saucepan, heat the broth over low heat to keep it warm.

In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and saut√© until they become translucent and fragrant.

Add the arborio rice to the pot and stir to coat the grains with the butter. Cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the rice becomes slightly translucent.

Add the white wine to the pot and stir until the liquid is absorbed.

Add a ladleful of warm broth to the pot and stir until the liquid is absorbed. Continue adding broth, one ladleful at a time, stirring constantly, until the rice is cooked and the mixture is creamy. This process should take about 20-25 minutes.

Once the rice is cooked to your liking, stir in the Parmesan cheese until it is melted and well incorporated. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Serve the risotto hot, garnished with additional Parmesan cheese and fresh herbs if desired.
