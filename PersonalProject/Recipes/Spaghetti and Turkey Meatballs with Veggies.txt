Instructions:
	1. In a large mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients for the turkey meatballs (ground turkey, bread crumbs, grated Parmesan, milk, egg, minced garlic, chopped parsley, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper). Mix well until evenly combined.
	2. Shape the turkey mixture into meatballs, about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter, and set them aside.
	3. Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.
	4. In a large skillet or pan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent.
	5. Add the sliced bell peppers, zucchinis, and mushrooms to the skillet. Cook for about 5-7 minutes until the vegetables are tender-crisp.
	6. Remove the cooked vegetables from the skillet and set them aside.
	7. In the same skillet, add another tablespoon of olive oil and cook the turkey meatballs until they are browned on all sides and cooked through (about 8-10 minutes).
	8. Pour the marinara sauce into the skillet with the meatballs and simmer for a few minutes until the sauce is heated through.
	9. Add the cooked vegetables to the skillet with the meatballs and sauce. Stir to combine and let it simmer for another 2-3 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
	10. Serve the turkey meatballs and vegetable sauce over the cooked spaghetti. Sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese on top before serving.
