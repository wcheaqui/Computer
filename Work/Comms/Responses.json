The function should take two parameters: the string to search for and the stop substring. It should then iterate through each line of the script, looking for the substring. When it finds a match, it should save the index of that line and then continue until it finds the stop substring. Once it finds the stop substring, it should return the starting and ending indices of the range of lines to be updated.

Will: there's not much swelling to it but it it my right side is actually lower than my left side and my right side is the one that's hurting there's:  Jarvis": "I see. That sounds like a classic symptom of a rotator cuff injury. I suggest we get an X-ray to get an accurate picture of what is going on and then I can advise you on the best course of treatment. In the meantime, I suggest you rest your shoulder and avoid any activities that involve lifting or rotating your arm too much, and take some over the counter anti-inflammatory medications to help reduce the pain and inflammation."
