Ingredients:

- 1 pound of firm white fish fillets (such as cod or haddock)
- 1 cup of all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon of salt
- 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 1 cup of breadcrumbs
- 1/2 teaspoon of paprika
- Vegetable oil for frying
- 2-3 large sweet potatoes, cut into wedges
- Salt and black pepper to taste

Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 425Â°F.

2. Peel the sweet potatoes and cut them into wedges. Toss them with a little bit of vegetable oil, salt, and black pepper. Spread them out in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until crispy and golden brown.

3. Cut the fish fillets into even-sized pieces.

4. In a shallow dish, mix together the flour, salt, and black pepper.

5. In another shallow dish, whisk together the beaten egg and a tablespoon of water.

6. In a third shallow dish, mix together the breadcrumbs and paprika.

7. Dip each piece of fish in the flour mixture, shaking off any excess. Then dip it in the egg mixture, letting any excess drip off. Finally, coat it in the breadcrumb mixture, pressing down gently to help it stick.

8. Heat 1 inch of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the breaded fish pieces in batches and fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through.

9. Remove the fish from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.

10. Serve the fish and chips with a side of tartar sauce, lemon wedges, and the roasted sweet potato wedges.
